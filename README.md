# FoundationCLI

FoundationCL is a command-line tool to support developers utilizing the Foundation library. We include different commands to scaffold parts of a developer's application, like commands to create a SimpleCommand class with all of the necessary starting code included in the class. 

This project is currently in development still. However, it provides a rich set of commands to scaffold different parts of their project.

# Installation
