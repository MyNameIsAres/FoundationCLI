# FoundationCLI

FoundationCL is a command-line tool to support developers utilizing the Foundation library. We include different commands to scaffold parts of a developer's application. Like commands to create a SimpleCommand class or a Listener class, with all of the necessary starting code included in the class. 

This project is currently in development still. However, it already includes a rich set of commands for developers to utilise.
